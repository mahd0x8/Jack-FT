# Jack-FT
Jack Fitness Trainer or Jack-FT is an Artificial Intelligence based personalized fitness trainer which moniters you while you exercise. 

I came up with the idea by observing some of the difficulties faced by those who just start out with fitness. In theory, we all know the exercise names and positions however at the time of actually carrying out each exercise, many with differences to their heights and weight end up getting injured. Initially our group decided to focus on the weight loss or body building aspects of fitness however we switched up midway into Yoga Exericises.

Code is the complete and predicting the results with great accuracy however it can be implemented for more exercises and also could be promoted for weight losing and gym exercies with motion detection as well.

I have used the concept of computer vision and created 6 machine learning models to predict the corectness of our actions with the help of Open-CV, mediapipe and mathematics.I have processed the data to get the accurate and otimized prediction.

Data is in the form of csv files. Csv Files are associated with different Exercises which contains the data at different joints which are mainly involved in these exercises and is labeled. Extraction.py is the code we used to extract the data from Images and adds the data to the data (csv) files.
